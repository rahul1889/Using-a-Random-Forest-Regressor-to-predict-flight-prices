This project aims to predict flight prices using machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Regressor. The model analyzes various factors such as airline, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, stops, and travel class to forecast ticket prices. By leveraging feature importance analysis and hyperparameter tuning, the project provides insights into key price determinants and optimizes prediction accuracy, potentially benefiting both travelers and the aviation industry.
